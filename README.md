# Learning Project: Terraform with CI/CD Automation

## Introduction
This repository contains a learning project focused on infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform. The project demonstrates automated deployment through CI/CD using GitHub Actions. It's designed as a hands-on project to understand and implement various AWS services and Terraform configurations.
